## Maintaining this file

Update this file when your changes affect what's documented here.

Keep a fact here only if an agent needs it **before** opening the relevant
file. If they'd see it on arrival, it belongs in a docblock next to the code —
reference the file instead of restating it. Passes the test: cross-file
contracts, `package.json` gotchas (JSON can't hold comments), build ordering,
where things live, decisions someone would otherwise undo. Fails it: how a
function behaves, resolution rules, a module's internal design.

Also update `CHANGELOG.md` when a change is user-facing — breaking, newly
allowed, or otherwise affects consumers of the published package.
Internal/contributor-only changes don't belong there.

## Architecture

Two phases:

**Build time (Node.js, `src/node/` + `src/plugin/`)** — `src/plugin/plugin.ts`
is the actual `RspressPlugin` registered via `liveDemoPluginRspress()`. On
`routeGenerated` it scans MDX files (`visitFilePaths.ts`) and for each
`<code src="..."/>` or ` ```lang live ` block collects the entry file and
everything it transitively imports (`collectDemoFiles.ts`).
External imports (react, etc.) are collected across all demos and exported
from one generated virtual module (`getVirtualModulesCode.ts`). `remarkPlugin.ts` then rewrites the
MDX AST so `<code src="..."/>` / ` ```lang live ` becomes
`<LiveDemo files={...} />`.

**Runtime (browser, `src/web/`)** — user edits code in a CodeMirror-based
editor, bundled with the package. On change: Babel
(`@babel/standalone`, loaded from CDN) transpiles JSX/TS, then Rollup
(`@rollup/browser`, also CDN) bundles the modules using a custom resolver
plugin that resolves `./Button` against the importing file's
directory to a key in the `files` record. The bundle is then evaluated with
`new Function` and rendered into the host page's React tree — see the
isolation model below.

### Isolation model: there isn't one

Demo code is **not** sandboxed. `CodeRunner` evaluates the bundle via
`new Function(...)` and renders the result with `createElement` directly in
the host React tree, wrapped only in a `react-error-boundary`. There is no
iframe, no Worker, no origin separation anywhere in `src/`.

What that means, and what it costs:

- Demos share the page's **React instance** (deliberate — it's how hooks work
  at all), plus its **globals and styles**, which leak both ways.
- Demo code runs in the **host origin**, with access to the page's DOM,
  `localStorage`, and cookies.
- The error boundary catches render errors. It is not a security boundary.

This is a reasonable trade for a docs tool where demo authors are as trusted
as the docs themselves — which is the assumption baked in today. It stops
being reasonable for untrusted demo sources, or if demos need style
isolation. Moving to an iframe would be a breaking architectural change, so
it's a major-version decision. Until then: this section is the honest
description, don't call it a sandbox.

### Dependency gotchas

These live here because `package.json` can't hold comments — everything else
about a file is documented in the file itself.

`@babel/standalone` and `@rollup/browser` are **exact-pinned** in
`devDependencies` to match the CDN URLs in `src/node/htmlTags.ts`, which are
the actual runtime versions. Bump one, bump the other in the same commit.
Full rationale is in that file's header; `tests/node/htmlTags.test.ts`
enforces it.

Type packages (`@types/babel__core`, `@types/babel__standalone`) deliberately
stay on Babel 7 even though the runtime is on `@babel/standalone@8` —
`@babel/standalone` ships no types and has no v8 DefinitelyTyped stub, so
pairing it with a real `@babel/core@8` creates a v7/v8 type split-brain
requiring `as unknown as` casts. Don't "modernize" them independently.

`@mdx-js/mdx`, `mdast-util-mdx`, `remark-gfm`, `unified`, and
`unist-util-visit` live in `peerDependencies` only (no `dependencies`/
`devDependencies` entry) since `tsdown` leaves them external in `dist/` and
the real runtime copy must be `@rspress/core`'s own. Don't delete or move
them — pnpm's peer-auto-install is what makes them resolvable for this
package's own build/typecheck/test, pulling them from `@rspress/core`'s
tree, so removing the peerDependencies entries breaks the build with an
opaque `TS2307: Cannot find module` error.

### The build→runtime seam

The one contract spanning both phases: **`files` is keyed by each file's path
relative to the entry file's directory**, posix-style. The build step
(`collectDemoFiles.ts`) produces those keys; the runtime resolver
(`pluginResolveModules.ts`) resolves imports against them. Both go through
`shared/pathHelpers.ts`. Change one side, change the other — and check
`tests/integration/buildToRuntime.test.ts`, the only test that spans the seam.
Every unit test on either half can pass while a demo renders nothing.

Note that build time deliberately does _not_ bundle: it only collects
reachable files and external package names. Rollup owns bundling, in the
browser. See `collectDemoFiles.ts` for why that boundary is where it is.

## Key files

```

├── plugin/           # RspressPlugin entry point (plugin.ts, index.ts)
├── node/             # build-time: MDX scanning, file collection, remark transform
│   └── helpers/       # collectDemoFiles, analyzeModule, readAndParseFile, resolveFileInfo, getVirtualModulesCode, ...
├── shared/           # types, path helpers, constants used by both sides
│   └── errors/        # LiveDemoError, ErrorCode messages — see Troubleshooting
└── web/              # runtime: editor + in-page preview
    ├── compiler/      # Babel/Rollup pipeline that bundles and evaluates a demo in the browser
    ├── components/    # generic building blocks (Button, ToggleButtonGroup)
    └── ui/            # one directory per component — Core (top-level layout),
                        # Editor, FileTabs, Preview, CodeRunner, ControlPanel,
                        # ResizablePanels, Wrapper
```

Component exports are unprefixed (`Core`, `Editor`, `CodeRunner`, …) — the
package name already namespaces them; consumers import and alias as needed
(see `static/LiveDemo.tsx` for the default layout, or
`website/src/CustomLiveDemo/LiveDemo.tsx` for a custom one).

Path aliases (`~node/*`, `~shared/*`, `~web/*`) map to `src/node`, `src/shared`,
`src/web` — see `tsconfig.json` / `vitest.config.ts`.

**Build must run before typecheck.** `static/LiveDemo.tsx` imports the
package's own public API by its published specifier (`@live-demo/rspress/web`),
which resolves through `package.json`'s `exports` map to `dist/`. If `dist`
doesn't exist yet, that import fails typecheck with a "Cannot find module"
error — it doesn't fail quietly. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs
`build:lib` before `typecheck` for this reason, and `pnpm verify` (root `package.json` script) mirrors that order. Keep both in sync if either changes.

**Virtual module pattern**: user code can `import` external packages
(react, etc.) that aren't installed anywhere the demo can reach. Build time
generates one virtual module re-exporting everything referenced across all
demos on the page; at runtime `require('_live_demo_virtual_modules')`
returns a lookup function for it. See `getVirtualModulesCode.ts`.

Import resolution (which extensions, in what order, index files) is defined
by `getPossiblePaths` and the `LiveDemoLanguage` enum — documented at both.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test                  # all packages
pnpm test collectDemoFiles.test.ts
pnpm test --watch
```

Fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/` — **read its README before adding one.**
Two bugs have shipped past a fully green suite because a fixture had the
right extension and the wrong syntax.

## Limitations (of demo code, not the plugin's own source)

- No CSS modules in live demos — inline styles or external CSS only
- No dynamic imports — all imports must be static
- No Node.js APIs — demos run in the browser
- Only `.js(x)`/`.ts(x)` files are resolvable as imports

## Troubleshooting

Every error the plugin itself throws (build- or runtime-side) is a
`LiveDemoError` — `src/shared/errors/`, ported from castro's
`utils/errors.js` split. `errors.ts` holds the class and `toPayload()`
normalizer; `messages.ts` holds every `ErrorCode`'s wording, one factory per
code. `.message` is the fully formatted text; `.payload` is the structured
`{ code, title, message?, hint?, notes? }` the in-preview overlay
(`Preview.tsx`) renders instead. Two codes —
`UNDEFINED_NAMED_IMPORT`/`EXTERNAL_IMPORT_NOT_FOUND` — back `throw` strings
generated into a demo's own bundle (`babelPluginTraverse.ts`,
`getVirtualModulesCode.ts`); that code can't import the class at
demo-runtime, so `formatSplicedMessage()` joins their message + hint into a
plain string spliced in at generation time.

- **`IMPORT_NOT_RESOLVED`** ("Couldn't resolve import") — check the path
  against `getPossiblePaths`.
- **`EXTERNAL_IMPORT_NOT_FOUND`** ("Can't resolve import") — confirm it's a
  real dependency, and that it reached the virtual module
  (`getVirtualModulesCode.ts`).
- **`PARSE_FAILED`** — a demo file has a syntax error; the codeframe is
  attached as a payload note.
- **`NO_DEFAULT_EXPORT`** — the entry file's bundle didn't yield a default
  export.
- **`PROP_PARSE_FAILED`** — the plugin's `JSON.stringify`d props and the
  runtime's `JSON.parse` are out of sync; check `parseProps.ts`.
- **`INVALID_CUSTOM_LAYOUT`** — the `customLayout` plugin option's path
  doesn't end in `LiveDemo.(jsx?|tsx)`.
- **A demo picks up the wrong files** — log `Object.keys(files)` at the end of
  `collectDemoFiles.ts`; that's the exact record the browser receives.
