import {Tab, Tabs, Badge, Card} from "rspress/theme";

You can use built-in components:

```jsx live
import { Badge, Card } from "rspress/theme";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Badge type="info">
        Some Badge
      </Badge>
      <Card
        title="Card Title"
        content="Card Content"
      />
    </div>
  )
};
```


In MDX:

````
```jsx live
import { Badge, Card } from "rspress/theme";

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Badge type="info">
        Some Badge
      </Badge>
      <Card
        title="Card Title"
        content="Card Content"
      />
    </div>
  )
};
```
