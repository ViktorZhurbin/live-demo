"External" demos allow you to write code in dedicated files, declutter MDX markup, and take advantage of your IDE's features.

## Imports
In external demos, all imported modules will be resolved at build time. Make sure you have installed them as the project's dependencies.


## Example
This MDX file includes an external demo defined as:
```tsx
<code src="./snippets/basics/Basic" />
```

Which turns into:
<code src="./snippets/basics/Basic" />
