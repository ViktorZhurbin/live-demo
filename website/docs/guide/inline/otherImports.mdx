title: Other imports

 External modules are not automatically resolved in inline demos (as they are in ["external" demos](../external/basics.mdx#imports)). Ie, if you have `import { DateTime } from "luxon"` in the code block, it won't work out of the box.

 > [!NOTE]
 >
 > If any of your "external" demos has an import from this library (ie, `import { ... } from "luxon"`), it will be available in your "inline" demos as well.

 As an alternative, you can use `includeModules` option of the plugin.

 ## `includeModules`

`includeModules` option allows you to define modules that will be available in all demos. For example:

```ts title='rspress.config.ts'
import { defineConfig } from "rspress/config";
import { rspressPluginLiveDemo } from "rspress-plugin-live-demo";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    rspressPluginLiveDemo({
      includeModules: ["luxon"],
    }),
  ],
  // ...
})
```
 Now you can use `import { ... } from "luxon"` in any demo.
