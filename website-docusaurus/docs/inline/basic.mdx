To turn a code block into a live demo, add `live` after the language meta string.

This code block:

````
```jsx live
export const App = () => {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
};
```
````

Turns into this live demo:

```jsx live
export const App = () => {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
};
```

This code block:

````
```tsx live
import React from "react";

export const App = (): React.FC => {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
};
```
````

Turns into this live demo:

```tsx live
import React from "react";

export const App = (): React.FC => {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
};
```
